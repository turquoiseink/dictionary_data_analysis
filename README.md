# dictionary_data_analysis
This repository contains diferent programs to scrap data from online dictionaries and process them.

Right now I have a code that scraps all the data from the spanish dictionary of the Real Academia Espa√±ola.

  IMPORTANT!! This code may fill up your RAM memory, so it is recommended to divide in 2 or 3 batches all the computations, e.g. from 'a' to 'f', from 'f' to 'p', and from 'p' to 'z'.
